    "# Employee Relocation Analysis: Capstone Project\n",
    "\n",
    "**Company:** WXYZ,Brooklyn, NY, USA <br>\n",
    "**Presented by:** <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/samuelnnitiwetheophilus/\">Samuel Nnitiwe Theophilus</a>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background \n",
    "\n",
    "A Company's best resource and its largest costs are the people who bring creativity, productivity and ultimately profitability to a company- It's Employees. A good talent management program can improve an employer's competitiveness, but it does not ensure that the talent is located where it is most needed. \n",
    "\n",
    "In a situation where an Organization wishes to expand its branch to a new location, there will be a need to deploy staff. While it is possible for the Company to hire new talents, using current capable employees who are already familiar with the company structure and operations is the best decision for the organization in terms of Cost & overhead time required to staff to adapt and  handle its operations.\n",
    "The Company will  need to find a way to relocate some keys employees for continued career development or to bring their knowledge to different subsidiaries or locations. These moves can be a daunting task for the company and a high-stress situation for the employee. If a relocation is not handled successfully, it threatens the employer's ability to retain the employee—and it risks losing someone the employer has devoted time and money to develop and move.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "The **WXYZ Company** has been operating in --Brooklyn,New York-- for the past 5 years. This year, the board made the decision to open an office in --Coventry, England-- and would like to select some of its existing employees to fill some managerial roles at its new branch.\n",
    "This Data Science project aims to compare the neighbourhoods in Brooklyn, New York (Current company location) with the neighbourhoods in Coventry(New Branch)  and **create Clusters of similar neighbourhoods**. This will help the company to:\n",
    "1. Identify Employees who would have a smoother transition to the new branch(by identifying if their current residential address matches a cluster in the new location).\n",
    "2. Identify Locations to consider as recommendation for employees who agree to relocate.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "\n",
    "I will use the **Foursquare API** to explore neighborhoods in Brooklyn and Conventry. I will the explore the most common venue categories in each neighborhood, and then use this feature to group the neighborhoods into clusters.\n",
    "I will convert addresses into their equivalent latitude and longitude values. \n",
    "Finally, I will use the Folium library to visualize the neighborhoods in Brooklyn, Coventry and their emerging clusters.\n",
