# Coursera_Capstone
The Capstone project uses the Foursquare location API to solve the 'Battle of Neighbourhood analysis'. This runs majors analysis to compare similar communities.


Projects
1. Segmentation & Clustering projec ton Toronto Data: In this project, I scrapped wikipedia for Neighbourhood data and preprocessed the data. The data was also visualized after extracting the respective cooridinates.

2. Employee Relocation Analysis: Capstone Project (Main Project):

Background

A Company's best resource and its largest costs are the people who bring creativity, productivity and ultimately profitability to a company- It's Employees. A good talent management program can improve an employer's competitiveness, but it does not ensure that the talent is located where it is most needed. 

In a situation where an Organization wishes to expand its branch to a new location, there will be a need to deploy staff. While it is possible for the Company to hire new talents, using current capable employees who are already familiar with the company structure and operations is the best decision for the organization in terms of Cost & overhead time required to staff to adapt and handle its operations.
The Company will need to find a way to relocate some keys employees for continued career development or to bring their knowledge to different subsidiaries or locations. These moves can be a daunting task for the company and a high-stress situation for the employee. If a relocation is not handled successfully, it threatens the employer's ability to retain the employeeâ€”and it risks losing someone the employer has devoted time and money to develop and move.

Problem Definition

The WXYZ Company has been operating in Brooklyn, New York, USA for the past 5 years. This year, the board made the decision to open an office in Coventry, England and would like to select some of its existing employees to fill some managerial roles at its new branch.
This Data Science project aims to compare the neighborhoods in Brooklyn, New York (Current company location) with the neighborhoods in Coventry (New Branch) and create Clusters of similar neighborhoods. 
This will help the company to:
1.	Identify Employees who would have a smoother transition to the new branch (by identifying if their current residential address matches a cluster in the new location).
2.	Identify Locations to consider as recommendation for employees who agree to relocate.
